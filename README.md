Requirements
------------
site-make requires two features not available currently in Drush 6, drush make's
--no-recursion flag and autoloading. Use the master branch and install drush
with composer to get this to work.

  If you're including multiple make files, all properties need keys. For example...

  This is bad:

     example1.make has this line: includes[] = exampleA.make
     example2.make has this line: includes[] = exampleB.make

  This is good:

     example1.make has this line: includes[a] = exampleA.make
     example2.make has this line: includes[b] = exampleB.make

  And this is good:

     build-example.make has this line:  includes[base] = path/to/base.make
     base.make has this line:           includes[core] = drupal-org-core.make
     base.make also has this line:      includes[contrib] = drupal-org.make
